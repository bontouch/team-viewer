# The server

The backend was created using firestore cloud functions so please log into the firebase console
using:

### `firebase login`

or

### `firebase login --reauth`

If you cannot run the code above then make sure you have the firebase cli installed. You can get it
by running:

### `npm install -g firebase-tools`

## Available Scripts

In order to run the server locally, navigate to the functions directory within server and run:

### `npm run serve`

Please keep in mind that you cannot run the firebase cron jobs locally, they will have to be
deployed

To deploy the backend functions simply navigate to the functions folder and run:

### `firebase deploy`

To add a secret without logging into the firebase UI simply run:

### `firebase functions:secrets:set GOOGLE_AUTH_CLIENT_ID`

And then paste or write your secret for that key In the example above we set the secret for the key
GOOGLE_AUTH_CLIENT_ID

The client was made using create-react-app

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for
more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time.
This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel,
ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except
`eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this
point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle
deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this
tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
